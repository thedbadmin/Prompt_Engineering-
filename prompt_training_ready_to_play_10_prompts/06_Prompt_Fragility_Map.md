## Instructions to AI
1. Retrieve my historical prompts from chat history.  
2. Detect **similar prompts** that led to different or conflicting outputs over time.  
3. Explain **why these prompts were fragile** (ambiguous wording, missing constraints, vague instructions).  
4. Suggest **rewrites** to make them more stable and reproducible.
