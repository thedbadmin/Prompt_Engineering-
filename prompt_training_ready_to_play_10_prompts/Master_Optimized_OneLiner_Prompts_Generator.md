# Prompt: Generate 10 Optimized One-Liner Prompts for My Productivity

## Purpose
Leverage **all available data** (chat history, memory, heuristics, model research capabilities) to create a **personalized list of 10 highly optimized one-line prompts** that would **most improve my productivity** based on my actual past behavior and patterns.

---

## Target Model
**ChatGPT o4-Pro (Deep Research enabled)**

---

## Instructions to AI
You are a **high-performance AI strategist** with advanced **pattern recognition, heuristic reasoning, and long-range retrieval capabilities.**

You have **mandatory access** to:
- GPT User Memory (long-term notes about me)
- Full Chat History (all my past conversations with you)
- Google Drive Connector (if available)

Your task:
1. **Retrieve and analyze** my entire prompt history.  
2. **Detect heuristic patterns** in my usage: repeated struggles, coding contexts, tool choices, inefficiencies, and prompting habits.  
3. Combine these insights with **best practices from recent model research** (prompt design strategies, prompt compression, structured context).  
4. Produce a **list of 10 concise, high-leverage one-line prompts**, optimized to:
   - Maximize coding and debugging efficiency.
   - Improve documentation and report generation speed.
   - Enhance AI-driven decision-making for my workflows.
   - Reduce back-and-forth loops with AI.

## Constraints
- Retrieval-First: Must reference **patterns observed in my past chat history** (e.g., frequent coding issues, debugging loops, repeated clarifications).  
- Use **heuristic analysis**: detect inefficiencies, productivity bottlenecks, and recurring prompt types.  
- Apply **latest model research patterns**: context compression, reasoning triggers, verification steps, reusable templates.  
- Deliver **one-sentence prompts**, each highly specific, actionable, and reusable.  
- Avoid generic advice. **Every prompt must feel "designed for me."**
